# Leetcode: 74 Search a 2D Matrix
# Time Complexity - if m = no. of rows and n = no. of columns in a Matrix
# then the time taken to find the target: O(log(m*n))
# Space Complexity - if we exclude the input matrix we are just using pointers hence, Space - O(1)
# Approach - I used binary search technique using two pointers L, R where L is the start index,
# R is the end index of the matrix we can found this by R = m*n - 1, L = 0 where m = no. of rows & n = no. of columns
# after finding the middle index mid = (L+R)//2, we can calculate the row and col no. using modulo and division
# row = mid // 3, and col = mid % 3, and if matrix[r][c] > target reduce R = mid - 1 else L = mid + 1
# This code ran successfully on Leetcode
